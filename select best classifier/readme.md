This notebook explains how to select the best classifier to predict no-shows. To use it, overwrite the data.csv file with your own appointment data file:
<ul>
<li>One row per appointment
<li>One column for each feature, including a column <b>Noshow</b> with a binary indicator of no-show
</ul>

Then, run the jupyter notebook.
